# Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as either positive or negative using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

## Project Overview
The model is built using Python and TensorFlow to predict the sentiment of movie reviews. The goal of this project is to preprocess text data, build a deep learning model (LSTM), and evaluate the model on test data to classify movie reviews accurately.

## Key Components
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize the IMDb dataset text reviews for model training.
- **Model Architecture**: Built using an LSTM-based model for text classification.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated based on accuracy using test data.

## Files
- `Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that contains the implementation of the Sentiment Analysis model.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, setup instructions, and how to use the code.
